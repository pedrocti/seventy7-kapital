Transform the current Testimonial section into a **Blog Posts** section with three cards as follows:

1. **Layout & Style**  
   - Dark Web3 background with animated starfield continuing through this section.  
   - Cards in a responsive grid: 1-column on mobile, 3-columns on desktop, with consistent `gap-6`.  
   - Each card: semi-transparent backdrop (`backdrop-blur-md`), rounded corners, subtle border glow (`from-blue-400 to-purple-500`), padding `p-6`.

2. **Card Content**  
   - **Title**, **Date**, **Excerpt**, and a **Read More** button.  
   - Use a clean sans-serif font: `Poppins` or `Inter`.  
   - Title: `text-xl font-semibold`, Date: `text-sm text-gray-400`, Excerpt: `text-base leading-relaxed`, Button: `mt-4 inline-flex items-center text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-200`.

3. **Modal Popups**  
   - On clicking **Read More**, open a full-screen modal (or slide-in panel) that:
     - Maintains the starfield background behind a dark semi-opaque overlay.  
     - Displays the **full blog post** (you may hardcode 3–4 paragraphs of content for each).  
     - Includes a close icon (`×`) top right to dismiss.  
     - Has smooth fade-in/fade-out animations.

4. **Blog Post Details**  
   - **Post 1**  
     - Title: “From 9-to-5 to Passive Income”  
     - Full Content: Write 3–4 paragraphs describing how Seventy7 Kapital’s mentorship and funded accounts help professionals build passive income.  
   - **Post 2**  
     - Title: “Mastering Trading Psychology”  
     - Full Content: 3–4 paragraphs on the psychological training and support Seventy7 provides.  
   - **Post 3**  
     - Title: “Scale Your Account with Prop Firm Assist”  
     - Full Content: 3–4 paragraphs detailing the challenge prep, strategy optimization, and evaluation assistance.

5. **Navigation & Accessibility**  
   - Ensure modals are keyboard-accessible (ESC to close).  
   - Responsive design: modals look great on mobile and desktop.  
   - Maintain consistent color scheme and typography.

Implement this whole blog section so that users can discover educational content and naturally click through to launch the Telegram bot via a **“Start with 77AccessBot”** link/button at the bottom of each modal.
